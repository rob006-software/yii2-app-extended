Yii 2 Extended Project Template
============================

Yii 2 Extended Project Template is a skeleton [Yii 2](http://www.yiiframework.com/) application best for
rapidly creating small projects.

The template contains the basic features including user login/logout and a contact page.
It includes all commonly used configurations that would allow you to focus on adding new
features to your application.

      web/                contains the entry script and Web resources



REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.


INSTALLATION
------------

### Install from an Archive File

Extract the archive file downloaded from [yiiframework.com](http://www.yiiframework.com/download/) to
a directory named `app` that is directly under the Web root.

Set cookie validation key in `config/web-local.php` file to some random secret string:

```php
'request' => [
    // !!! insert a secret key in the following (if it is empty) - this is required by cookie validation
    'cookieValidationKey' => '<secret random string goes here>',
],
```

You can then access the application through the following URL:

~~~
http://localhost/app/web/
~~~


### Install via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install this project template using the following command:

~~~
php composer.phar global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:~1.2.0"
php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist --stability=dev rob006/yii2-app-extended app
~~~

Now you should be able to access the application through the following URL, assuming `app` is the directory
directly under the Web root.

~~~
http://localhost/app/web/
~~~


CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Local config files

Usually each application has some configuration that should not be shared between different installations
and should not be stored in [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control), for
example personal keys or configuration specific for a particular server. In `config` directory you can find
a set of config files prefixed by `-local.php` - these files are designed for storing such a configuration.
These local configs are added to `.gitignore` and never will be pushed to source code repository, so you can safely
use it for override some general config. For example `config/web-local.php` will override some settings
from `config/web.php` (see [ArrayHelper::merge()](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-helper-array.html#merging-arrays)
for more details). Then `config/web.php` contains general configuration of web application shared with
all installations and `config/web-local.php` contains configuration specific only for local installation.

In `config/templates` directory you can find templates for local config files. On first run `composer install`
these files will be copied to `config` directory. You can edit these templates to adjust default content of
local config files, but **you should not store any private data in templates** - these should be put into
`config/*-local.php` files after installation.


### Database

Edit the file `config/db-local.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2app',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.



TESTING
-------

Tests are located in `tests` directory. They are developed with [Codeception PHP Testing Framework](http://codeception.com/).
By default there are 3 test suites:

- `unit`
- `functional`
- `acceptance`

Tests can be executed by running

```
composer exec codecept run
```

The command above will execute unit and functional tests. Unit tests are testing the system components, while functional
tests are for testing user interaction. Acceptance tests are disabled by default as they require additional setup since
they perform testing in real browser.


### Running  acceptance tests

To execute acceptance tests do the following:

1. Rename `tests/acceptance.suite.yml.example` to `tests/acceptance.suite.yml` to enable suite configuration

2. Replace `codeception/base` package in `composer.json` with `codeception/codeception` to install full featured
   version of Codeception

3. Update dependencies with Composer

    ```
    composer update
    ```

4. Download [Selenium Server](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) and launch it:

    ```
    java -jar ~/selenium-server-standalone-x.xx.x.jar
    ```

5. (Optional) Create `yii2_app_tests` database and update it by applying migrations if you have them.

   ```
   tests/bin/yii migrate
   ```

   The database configuration can be found at `config/testdb-local.php`.


6. Start web server:

    ```
    tests/bin/yii serve
    ```

7. Now you can run all available tests

   ```
   # run all available tests
   composer exec codecept run

   # run acceptance tests
   composer exec codecept run acceptance

   # run only unit and functional tests
   composer exec codecept run unit,functional
   ```

### Code coverage support

By default, code coverage is disabled in `codeception.yml` configuration file, you should uncomment needed rows to be able
to collect code coverage. You can run your tests and collect coverage with the following command:

```
#collect coverage for all tests
composer exec codecept run -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml

#collect coverage only for unit tests
composer exec codecept run unit -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml

#collect coverage for unit and functional tests
composer exec codecept run functional,unit -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml
```

You can see code coverage output under the `tests/_output` directory.
